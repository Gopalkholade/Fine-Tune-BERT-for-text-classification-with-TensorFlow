## Fine-Tune BERT for Text Classification with tensorflow
This is a guided project with Coursera Project Network
In this [project](https://www.coursera.org/projects/fine-tune-bert-tensorflow/), you will learn how to fine-tune a BERT model for text classification using TensorFlow and TF-Hub.

The pretrained BERT model used in this project is [available](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12/2) on [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/).

A downloadable copy of the [Quora Insincere Questions Classification data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/data) can be found [https://archive.org/download/fine-tune-bert-tensorflow-train.csv/train.csv.zip](https://archive.org/download/fine-tune-bert-tensorflow-train.csv/train.csv.zip). Decompress and read the data into a pandas DataFrame.
